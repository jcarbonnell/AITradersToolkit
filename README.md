## Description

The AI Trader's Toolkit aims to provide rookie traders, students and AI beginners with an educative dashboard to learn AI-assisted financial analysis. It will propose a series of modules (widgets) for streaming financial data from stock and crypto markets, and ploting the results from different forcasting models. With this modular dashboard, the user will be able to compare, learn and test financial strategies strategies and AI models in the most visual way. 

This project fo not aim to compete with professional trading platforms, we focus on education to AI and finance, model interpretability and open science.

In the highly volatile crypto markets, mastering financial analytics, portfolio management, being tooled to select which forecasting techniques works best for your market, and understanding the intricacies of AI for predictive modeling is a matter of public interest. A comprehensive dashboard where users can access a series of interactive widgets, crafted to facilitate step-by-step learning and experimentation is a precious public good.

The AI Trader's Toolkit started as a course project within the [Advanced Time Series Prediction at opencampus.sh](https://edu.opencampus.sh/en/course/478). 

### Task Type

Financial Time Series Forecasting

### Results Summary

Forecasting financial markerts with AI is a popular use case and a lot of approaches have been experimented over history. Considering the time allocated to this project we decided to first experiment our AI forecasting tools on the p2p economy, in particular by selecting 15 nasdaq-listed companies in that industry, and 5 DePIN coins traded on crypto markets. We then selected three families of machine learning models adapted to financial forecasting to compare their results and build the first version of our dashboard: Long short-term memory (LSTM), Decision Trees, and Non-Linear Analysis. More details about the datasets and the models are available in the respective subfolders.

- **Best Model:** [Name of the best-performing model]
- **Evaluation Metric:** [e.g., Accuracy, F1-Score, MSE]
- **Result:** [e.g., 95% accuracy, F1-score of 0.8]
